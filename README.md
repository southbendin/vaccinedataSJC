Exploratory plots and statistics of vaccination counts in St. Joseph County Indiana

 The City of South Bend, St. Joseph County, and enFocus work each week to run analytics on State of Indiana vaccine dose data from the Indiana Gateway portal (Updated each Friday). We're sharing the scripts we use to de-identify and analyze the data for local decisionmakers, community organizers, and public health workers.
 
    We welcome all peers and partners interested in improving and adding to this script! 
    City of South Bend Senior Business Analyst in the Department of Innovation & Technology was lead analyst on this project! Please email her at eamodei@southbendin.gov if you have questions. 
    If you're a county/municipalities in Indiana and you don't have staff expertise/comfort in R and want some assistance or training, please contact enfocus at g.shaw@en-focus.org.
